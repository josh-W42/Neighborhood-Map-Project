# Neighborhood Map Project

This is an assessment project for Udacity's React Fundamentals course. This project consists of an app built with React, that resembles a Neighborhood map with search capabilities.

## Getting Started

To get started developing right away:

* install some project dependencies with `npm install`, refer to the following project dependencies for additional steps.
* start the development server with `npm start`
* To run the app in production mode use command `npm run build`. This will build the app for production in the build folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
* To view in production use command `serve -s build` for serving in static server.
